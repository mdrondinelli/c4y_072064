      n = n - 2
    end
    ```

1. What is the value of `n` after the loop exits in the following snippet?

    ```lua
    local n = 1
    while n < 10 do
      n = n * 2
    end
    ```

1. What is the value of `m` after the loop exits in the following snippet?

    ```lua
    local n = 10
    local m = 0
    while n >= 2 do
      n = n / 2
      m = m + 1
    end
    ```
